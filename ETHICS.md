# Ethics & Intent

This project exists to support understanding, reflection, and healthier collaboration.

It does NOT exist to:
- Evaluate human worth
- Predict performance or success
- Make hiring, firing, or promotion decisions
- Diagnose mental health or personality disorders
- Enforce conformity or labeling

We explicitly reject:
- Discriminatory use
- Personality-based exclusion
- Coercive profiling
- Surveillance or behavioral control

All outputs are:
- Contextual
- Probabilistic
- Non-prescriptive

The platform is a mirror, not a verdict.
