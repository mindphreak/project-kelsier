# Project Kelsier


> *"There's always another secret."* - Building better teams through deep psychological insight.

> AI-powered team dynamics platform using deep psychological frameworks and continuous behavioral analysis.

## 🎯 Vision

Most team collaboration tools use surface-level psychology. Project Kelsier goes deeper - analyzing cognitive functions, enneagram dynamics, and real communication patterns to provide actionable insights for better team collaboration.

## ✨ What Makes This Different

- **Deep Psychology**: Cognitive functions (Ti/Te/Fi/Fe/Ni/Ne/Si/Se) + Enneagram integration
- **Continuous Evolution**: Real-time behavioral analysis, not static assessments
- **Privacy-First**: Individual empowerment over surveillance
- **Open Source**: Apache 2.0 licensed, community-driven development

## 🚀 Current Status

**Phase 1 Genesis**: Requirements & Architecture Design

We're currently in the planning and documentation phase, gathering requirements and designing the system architecture. Contributions welcome!

## 🧠 Core Features (Planned)

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Voluntary psychological assessments (MBTI + cognitive functions, Enneagram)
- [ ] Team composition dashboard
- [ ] Communication style matching
- [ ] Basic collaboration insights

### Phase 2: Passive Analysis
- [ ] Slack/Teams integration for chat analysis
- [ ] Email pattern analysis
- [ ] Meeting sentiment analysis (Zoom/Meet)
- [ ] NLP-based communication pattern detection

### Phase 3: AI Insights
- [ ] Cognitive function inference from communication
- [ ] Conflict prediction and prevention
- [ ] Burnout prediction and methods to counter
- [ ] Personalized communication suggestions
- [ ] Team health metrics

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Proposed)

- **AI Models**: Llama 3.1, Mistral, Sentence Transformers
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI)
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js or React/TanStack Start
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + pgvector
- **ML Framework**: Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain

## 🤝 Contributing

We're looking for collaborators in:
- **Psychology**: Organizational psychologists, MBTI/Enneagram experts
- **AI/ML**: NLP engineers, model fine-tuning specialists
- **Frontend**: React developers passionate about UX
